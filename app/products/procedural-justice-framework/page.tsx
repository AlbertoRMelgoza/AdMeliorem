        investigation processes that prevent escalation and contain liability. After the first mention, Procedural Justice

        <p>This framework functions as a critical control by embedding:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Fair &amp; Defensible Complaint Handling Systems</strong> â†’ aligned with WHS Codes of Practice,
            Respect@Work, and regulator expectations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Investigation Protocols</strong> â†’ consistent, transparent, and procedurally fair, reducing disputes
            and escalation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Remediation Mechanisms</strong> â†’ trusted systems for addressing harm, restoring fairness, and
            maintaining organisational integrity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Toolkit &amp; Training</strong> â†’ templates, guidance, and skill-building for HR, managers, and
            investigators to apply procedural justice in practice.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p style={{ marginTop: 16 }}>By design, the Procedural Justice Framework enables organisations to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Prevent costly escalation by eliminating gaps in process that regulators target.</li>
          <li>Contain liability by demonstrating that systems â€” not just policies â€” are live and defensible.</li>
          <li>Protect trust with employees and regulators by embedding fairness and transparency.</li>
          <li>
            Provide evidence of due diligence when psychosocial claims arise, shifting liability away from systemic
            failure.
