<p>Ad Meliorem - Terms and Conditions</p>
<p>Effective Date: 26/08/2025</p>
<p>1. Acceptance of Terms</p>
<p>By purchasing or using any services or products from Ad Meliorem (ABN: 93 710 507 818), you (“client” or “customer”) agree to these Terms and Conditions. This agreement is legally binding from the moment of purchase or subscription.</p>
<p>2. Nature and Purpose of Services</p>
<p>Ad Meliorem is a sole practice providing corporate consulting, diagnostics, and facilitation in psychosocial risk, compliance, and organisational culture. Services include:</p>
<p>Procedural Justice Framework™: Incident, complaint, and investigation process protocols to minimise liability.</p>
<p>Culture Risk Diagnostic™: Subscription-based and modular risk diagnostics (COPSOQ, SHEQ, OCAS, Pulse Surveys).</p>
<p>SHSARC™ and RCABH™ Workshops: Training and prevention for sexual harassment, bullying, aggression, and organisational culture harm.</p>
<p>Mediation Services: Accredited workplace mediation for conflict and liability minimisation.</p>
<p>Negotiation Services: Advisory, coaching, and support for high-stakes and risk-related workplace negotiation.</p>
<p>All offerings are designed to prevent, identify, and mitigate misconduct, wrongful behaviour, and regulatory risk. Ad Meliorem stands for ethical conduct, fair process, and compliance.</p>
<p>3. No Absolute Guarantee; Limitation of Liability</p>
<p>While my protocols and advice aim to significantly reduce risk, harm, and liability, the elimination of all risk is not guaranteed. Outcomes depend in part on client implementation and factors outside my control.</p>
<p>Liability Cap: To the maximum extent permitted by law, my aggregate liability for any claim, dispute, or loss is limited to the total fees paid by you for the relevant purchased services.</p>
<p>Fraud &amp; Ethical Carve-Out: My business is to help prevent wrongful behaviour and misconduct, not to perpetrate it. This contract makes no implication of wrongdoing. However, nothing in these terms’ limits liability for any fraud, wilful misconduct, gross negligence, or intentional breaches of confidentiality by either party.</p>
<p>4. Addressing Suspected Wrongdoing or Fraud</p>
<p>If you perceive or suspect any fraud, ethical breach, or wrongful behaviour concerning my services, notify me immediately at am@albertormelgoza.com. I will investigate promptly and transparently; I will engage a third-party investigation or review and mediation may be arranged as appropriate. Remedial action will be taken for any substantiated finding.</p>
<p>5. Payment Terms</p>
<p>Fees and payment intervals are provided on my website and are advised in writing.</p>
<p>Prices are exclusive of GST unless otherwise stated and GST fee will incur.</p>
<h2 style="margin:18px 0 6px">Payment is due within 30 days of purchase.</h2>
<p>Failure to pay may result in service suspension, late fees, and recovery action.</p>
<p>6. Data Ownership, Usage, and Cyber Security</p>
<p>Data generated during any engagement (including assessments, diagnostics, surveys, reports, interviews, mediation, or workshops) is jointly owned by you and Ad Meliorem (ABN: 93 710 507 818).</p>
<p>Aggregated or anonymised data may be used for benchmarking, analytics, or service improvement. All handling of organisational information follows my Privacy Policy and Australian law.</p>
<p>Cyber Security &amp; Incident Response: Your data and my systems are protected using up-to-date cyber security protocols aligned with Australian Cyber Security Centre best practice. In the event of a cyber incident, affected clients and (where required) regulatory bodies will be notified as soon as practicable. Remediation and support will be provided as appropriate. Clients are responsible for the security of their own systems.</p>
<p>7. Intellectual Property (IP)</p>
<p>All templates, protocols, frameworks, reports, and related materials are my intellectual property, licensed to you for internal, non-commercial use only.</p>
<p>8. Service Scope, Modifications &amp; Interruptions</p>
<p>Service descriptions included resources, and fees may be updated from time to time. Notice of material changes will be provided via email or website. I reserve the right to suspend services for non-payment, misuse, or other legitimate business reasons.</p>
<p>9. Client Responsibilities</p>
<p>Clients must provide accurate information, cooperate with protocols, and ensure proper implementation. The effectiveness of my work depends on your engagement and follow-through.</p>
<p>10. Term, Termination &amp; Refunds</p>
<p>Subscriptions auto-renew unless cancelled at least 30 days prior. Refunds are available only for non-delivery, proven gross negligence, or breach of contract. Either party may terminate this agreement for breach (following notice and a reasonable remedy period).</p>
<p>11. Privacy</p>
<p>No Identifiable Information: Ad Meliorem does not collect or store names, contact details, phone numbers, or other personal identifiers of individuals during psychosocial risk assessments, and diagnostics. At workshops products personal identifiers will be requested for the purpose of the building value at workshops. Names will not be stored or collected for any other purpose.</p>
<p>All data provided should be de-identified and non-attributable to any specific person.</p>
<p>If any personal information is inadvertently provided, it will be deleted or de-identified immediately in accordance with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and Australian Privacy Principles.</p>
<p>For general business engagement (such as contacting Ad Meliorem), personal information voluntarily submitted will be securely stored, never sold, and only disclosed as required by law or with explicit client consent. For privacy enquiries, contact am@albertormelgoza.com.</p>
<p>12. Governing Law, Jurisdiction, and International Clients</p>
<p>These Terms and Conditions are governed by the laws of Queensland, Australia. Disputes will be resolved by negotiation, mediation, or the courts of Queensland (non-exclusive jurisdiction). International clients are also bound to these terms unless otherwise agreed in writing and are responsible for compliance with local laws.</p>
<p>13. Dispute Resolution</p>
<p>Disputes will first be addressed through good faith negotiation and mediation. If unresolved, the courts of Queensland will decide the matter unless alternative arbitration is mutually agreed.</p>
<p>14. Contact Information</p>
<p>For questions, concerns, or complaints about these terms or privacy, contact am@albertormelgoza.com.</p>
<p>By accepting these terms and making a purchase, you confirm understanding and acceptance of all rights, responsibilities, and limitations set out above.</p>
<p>(To be reviewed and advised by a lawyer/law firm)</p>
